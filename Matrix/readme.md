I've always thought the screens in the Matrix movie were really cool and wondered how hard it would be to recreate them in Html5, JavaScript & CSS. There were a bunch of different scripts that were really close but in my mind not quite right. For example this codepen - https://codepen.io/P3R0/pen/MwgoKv.

I noticed two problems with this code, first it was too fast and second, the characters where chinese and according to the creator of the original screens they used Japanese Sushi recipes which are Kanji characters. I have modified the original pen to be slower, larger kanji characters and a different color. I created a CSSDeck - http://cssdeck.com/labs/bjk4rlqz - where you can go in and modify the code in real time or obviously you can download this githumb.
