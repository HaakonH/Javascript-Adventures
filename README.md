Just a place to put all my Javascript that interests me.

## Clock - Smooth Sweeping Secondhand
There are a million clock samples on the internet that are programmed in JavaScript. I wanted to have one that has a sweeping second hand similar to Rolex style watches. I couldn't find any good examples so I built this clock.

## Matrix Screensaver
I've seen a bunch of different matrix screensavers out there but none were what I envisioned so I created this version. Some of the examples used Chinese symbols, in the movie its clear that they are Japanese symbols so that is what I used for my version.
